# RXGiphy

This is the demo project for the Wednesday, November 7, 2018 **Intro to MVVM and FRP with RxSwift** SwiftCoders L.A. Meetup at Tradesy.

The *Starter* folder contains the existing MVC app that we will be converting to MVVM.

At the end of the Meetup the *Final* folder will contain the completed app converted to MVVM.

The *RxPlayground* folder contains a special workspace configured to show the number of RxObjects in use that we will use to learn RxSwift and explore proper memory management.
